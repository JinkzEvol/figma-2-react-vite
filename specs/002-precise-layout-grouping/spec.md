## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
 - üéØ Align with Constitution principles: Test-First Fidelity, Deterministic Output, Lean Architecture, Performance Budget, Transparent Observability, Explicit Scope, Clarity.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing a generated page from a Figma design, I want the footer (and similar multi-column structured sections) to reflect accurate layout, spacing, text content, icons, and hierarchy so I can visually validate design fidelity without manual code edits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Figma frame containing horizontally aligned groups forming a footer with consistent top alignment and even spacing, **When** the system extracts and renders it, **Then** the preview shows a multi-column footer with correct column count, preserved order, and reduced vertical whitespace (no large placeholder blocks).
2. **Given** text nodes in the footer with actual characters, **When** the preview renders, **Then** the real text appears with proper font size, weight, color, and line height instead of generic black bar placeholders.
3. **Given** social media vector/icon nodes in the design, **When** rendered, **Then** recognizable icons (inline SVG or equivalent) appear with accessible labels and not empty rectangles.
4. **Given** a footer frame with internal padding and gaps, **When** rendered, **Then** horizontal and vertical spacing matches Figma within defined tolerance (see Requirements) and total footer height is not inflated by placeholder stacking.
5. **Given** the viewport is narrowed below a responsive breakpoint, **When** columns cannot fit horizontally, **Then** they wrap or stack in a predictable order while preserving intra-column spacing.

### Edge Cases
- Extremely small viewport width causes columns to stack: footer still readable and spacing consistent.
- Missing or empty text nodes: skeleton placeholders display only for those nodes, not replacing populated siblings.
- Icon export failure: system displays a generic monochrome placeholder SVG sized to original node with accessible label (from layer name) and logs the failure event.
- Mixed alignment where only some siblings align: system does not incorrectly group them into a single column set. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Minimum grouping threshold?]
- Very large number of columns still forms a single horizontal group (no hard maximum) and relies on horizontal scrolling for visibility.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What breakpoint should trigger footer columns to wrap/stack? ‚Üí A: No breakpoint; never wrap. Horizontal scroll allowed.
- Q: How should we define column grouping limits? ‚Üí A: No max; group any ‚â•2.
- Q: For failed icon/vector exports, what fallback should appear? ‚Üí A: Generic monochrome placeholder SVG with accessible label.
- Q: What is the reference performance environment for timing targets? ‚Üí A: Mid laptop 4-core/8-thread ~2.4GHz, 16GB RAM.
- Q: What is the color fidelity tolerance policy? ‚Üí A: Brand colors exact; others ŒîE ‚â§3.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect candidate column groupings when ‚â•2 sibling groups share (a) identical top Y within tolerance (‚â§2px), (b) consistent horizontal gaps within ¬±4px variance, and (c) similar vertical internal structure.
- **FR-002**: System MUST represent a detected column grouping as a semantic container (multi-column footer section) with an ordered list of columns preserving original left-to-right order.
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract text style properties (font family, weight, size, line height, letter spacing, color, paragraph spacing) into reusable style tokens and reference them instead of rendering generic placeholders.
- **FR-004**: System MUST render actual text content when a text node has non-empty characters; placeholders (skeleton bars) MUST only appear when a node is empty or explicitly flagged for deferred content.
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract frame padding (top, right, bottom, left) and inter-column gap and apply these as layout spacing in the rendered footer.
- **FR-006**: System MUST honor Figma constraints without introducing automatic column wrapping; columns remain on a single horizontal line regardless of viewport width. If the viewport is narrower than total column width, a horizontal scrollbar MUST allow full-width inspection (no internal reflow/wrap).
- **FR-007**: System MUST export vector/icon nodes in the footer as inline SVG or accessible image elements with descriptive labels derived from layer names; on export failure it MUST render a generic monochrome placeholder SVG (maintaining size) with the same accessible label and log the failure.
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply semantic and accessible structure: container recognized as footer section; site title as heading level (h2 unless conflicting); link groups as lists with list items and navigable links; icons with aria-labels.
- **FR-009**: System MUST correctly resolve color & opacity for text and icons, falling back to inherited parent color before using a high-contrast placeholder.
- **FR-010**: System MUST de-duplicate identical text style definitions, issuing a single token/class reused across all matching nodes (deterministic naming rules documented separately).
- **FR-011**: System SHOULD cache normalized style and layout computations so repeated similar nodes do not exceed performance budget: added processing time < 10ms per column measured on reference environment (4-core/8-thread ~2.4GHz CPU, 16GB RAM, no turbo, single run warm cache).
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide deterministic output ordering for columns and items across runs given identical Figma input (tested via snapshot determinism).
- **FR-013**: System MUST expose instrumentation/log entries when grouping detected, skipped, or ambiguous for observability.
- **FR-014**: System MUST support any number of footer columns (‚â•2) in a single grouping without enforcing a hard maximum; overflow is handled exclusively via horizontal scrolling (no forced regrouping or truncation).
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide measurable fidelity tolerance: spacing & font sizes within ¬±1px of Figma; brand palette colors (as identified in design tokens) exact hex match; all other colors ŒîE ‚â§ 3 using CIEDE2000.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FooterSection**: Represents an extracted multi-column grouping of related footer content. Attributes: columns[], padding, gap, breakpoint policy, semantic role.
- **FooterColumn**: Represents a vertical collection of related nodes (text items, icons). Attributes: order index, items[], deduped style references.
- **TextStyleToken**: Logical style descriptor created from one or more Figma text nodes sharing identical style properties.
- **IconAsset**: Exported representation of a vector/icon with name, accessible label, svg content reference.
- **InstrumentationEvent**: Logging entity capturing decisions (group_detected, group_skipped_reason, style_dedup_applied, icon_export_failed).

<!-- Placeholder Key Entities section removed after clarifications to avoid confusion -->
